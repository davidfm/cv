%I am a highly motivated and passionate person, always trying to learn something new that will make me grow as a person and an IT professional.\\~\\
%In my current role at CGI's Open Digital Services centre I have been involved in many different activities on a big
%range of very different projects. Among others, I feel particularly proud about having successfully designed, implemented
%and managed and in-house air-gapped development environment used for a secure project;
%designing, implementing and rolled out an LDAP based solution used as a same sign-on system for the centre's self-hosted services and being part of the
%team that successfully prepared the Glasgow office for its first ISO27001 contributing towards the specification of
%procedures for backups, logging, user management and business continuity.
%Introducing Jenkins Pipelines (Jenkins jobs as code) to the Centre is something I feel particularly proud of as well.
%\\~\\
%My previous role as an Operation Developer for Ingresso Group involved being the only technical person in the Belfast office.
%I provided support to the Operations team and also worked on development with the other members of the Technology team, based in London.
%Mainly I wrote software tools for internal use, automating processes that until that time were done by hand. I also set up new deals and
%products on the company's backend systems and pulled information from the database to generate reports. My proudest moment was when, as its
%technology partner, we managed to support Amazon when they launched their West End ticket sales service.
%\\~\\
%My first role outside the University was as a Software Engineer for Nokia Networks in Finland. My responsabilities
%included taking over from an external supplier, developing new functionalities, fixing bugs, supporting the pilot users,
%administrating the database and Linux servers and configuring the hardware security modules. The result of this was the
%successful completion of an internal software integrity/security project and it helped me gain an understanding I did not
%have before about software security.
